Created a model to predict early stage diabetes through random forest method using Python. 

I used a data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.

Question: Can we develop an early stage diabetes predictor with the dataset?

I performed random forest using Python and achieved a predictor with 96% accuracy after separating the dataset into a training and testing dataset.

The dataset is cleaned through OpenRefine, please find the data dictionary below. The cleaned dataset is attached in the repository. 

The data dictionary is simple:
Female 0
Male 1
No 0 
Yes 1
Negative 0
Positive 1

There are two trees stored to explain the relationships between the variables. 

Please go through the code to identify the two most important variables.

p.s. This is my first ever post. Please be kind.
