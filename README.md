Created a model to predict early-stage diabetes through random forest, decision tree and support vector machine method using Python. 

Data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.

Question: Can we develop an early-stage diabetes predictor with the dataset?

I performed random forest through Jupyter Notebook and achieved a predictor with 96% accuracy after separating the dataset into a training and testing dataset.

The dataset is cleaned through OpenRefine, please find the data dictionary below. The cleaned dataset is attached in the repository. 

The data dictionary is simple:
Female 0
Male 1
No 0 
Yes 1
Negative 0
Positive 1

There are two trees stored to explain the relationships between the variables. 

Please go through the code to identify the two most important variables.
