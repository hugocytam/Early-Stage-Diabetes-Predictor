# Early-Stage-Diabetes-Predictor
Created a model to predict early stage diabetes through random forest method using Python. 

I used a data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.

Question: Can we develop an early stage diabetes predictor with the dataset?

I performed random forest using Python and achieved a predictor with 96% accuracy after separating the dataset into a training and testing dataset.

The data dictionary is simple:
Female 0
Male 1
No 0 
Yes 1
Negative 0
Positive 1

Please go through the code to identify the two most important variables.
